# rtiwebintegrationservice-examples
This repository includes examples that illustrate how to use _RTI Web
Integration Service_, an out-of-the-box solution for integrating web-based
applications and services with _RTI Connextâ„¢ DDS_.

##  RTI Web Integration Service
Traditionally, web-based applications and services have relied on non-standard
interfaces to participate as first-class citizens in the DDS Global Data Space.
_Web Integration Service_ leverages the
[Web-Enabled DDS OMG standard (DDS-WEB)](http://www.omg.org/spec/DDS-WEB) to provide
a simple generic standards-based interface that provides a transparent bridge
between web-based services and unmodified DDS applications.

Simply set up _Web Integration Service_ to create DDS entities associated with
web-based client applications. No changes are required in the _Connext DDS_
applications.

The key benefits of Web Integration Service are:
* It reduces the time and effort spent integrating web-based protocols with
_Connext DDS_ applications, providing a standards-based generic out-of-the-box
solution.
* It supports disconnected or stateless clients that would otherwise need to
join a domain, discover remote entities, and ensure that subscribers receive
the information they sent.
* It enables interoperability between applications written in different
programming languages and operating systems for which there is no available Connext DDS SDK.
* It provides access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized
applications can access the DDS Global Data Space.

To learn more about _RTI Web Integration Service_ check out its complete
[documentation](https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/current/doc/manuals/web_integration_service/index.html).
It includes detailed instructions as well as simple tutorials that will help
you get started.
